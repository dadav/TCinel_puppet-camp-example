With a practically empty nexus3_repository.rb type file, this is what we get with `puppet resource`:

```
▶ RUBYLIB=$(pwd)/lib puppet resource nexus3_repository --debug
Debug: Runtime environment: puppet_version=3.8.4, ruby_version=2.0.0, run_mode=user, default_encoding=UTF-8
Error: Could not run: nexus3_repository has no providers and has not overridden 'instances'
```

And this for `puppet apply`:

```
▶ RUBYLIB=$(pwd)/lib puppet apply -e "nexus3_repository {'blah': }"
Notice: Compiled catalog for tcinel.home.timcinel.com in environment production in 0.01 seconds
Error: No set of title patterns matched the title "blah".
```


Now, with a namevar specified in the type class, `puppet apply` works:

```
▶ RUBYLIB=$(pwd)/lib puppet apply -e "nexus3_repository {'blah': }"
Notice: Compiled catalog for tcinel.home.timcinel.com in environment production in 0.01 seconds
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.03 seconds
```
