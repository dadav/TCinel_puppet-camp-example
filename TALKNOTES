With a practically empty nexus3_repository.rb type file, this is what we get with `puppet resource`:

```
â–¶ RUBYLIB=$(pwd)/lib puppet resource nexus3_repository --debug
Debug: Runtime environment: puppet_version=3.8.4, ruby_version=2.0.0, run_mode=user, default_encoding=UTF-8
Error: Could not run: nexus3_repository has no providers and has not overridden 'instances'
```
